            <p> You probably think that you are better now, better now.
                You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around.
                You know I never meant to let you down, let you down.
                Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything.
                You know I say that I am better now, better now.
                I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around.
                You know I never meant to let you down, let you down. 
                Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything. </p>
            <p> I did not believe that it would end, no.
                Everything came second to the Benz oh.
                You're not even speaking to my friends, no.
                You knew all my uncles and my aunts though.
                Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes.
                We were looking forward to the rest of our lives.
                Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside.
                Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like.
                And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'.
                With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas.
                Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget.
                But I can't get this shit outta my head. </p>
